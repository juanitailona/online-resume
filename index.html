    <h2>Objective statement</h2>
    <p>I followed my passion into art history and obtained my degree in arts and culture studies.
        I have gained practical experience in logistics as a process manager and learned how to operate
        heavy machinery such as reachtrucks. I decided to switch up my career and currently work as an
        IT-consultant in the financial branch. For certain, I'm always looking for new ways to challenge
        myself. I am now an aspiring web developer and seek to incorporate creativity in my work. I have
        followed a woodworking course and aim to grow my skills in this field. My goal is to state that
        I build websites and furniture.
